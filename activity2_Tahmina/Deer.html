    <h3>
      Deer are ruminant mammals belonging to the family Cervidae. 
      There are over 60 different species of deer worldwide.
      Male deer are called bucks, females, are does, and the young are fawns.
      They are found to live in every region around the world except for Australia and Antarctica. 
      They can jump up to 10ft high. 
      The average speed for a deer is 35 miles per hour for a short distance. 
      As deer eyes are on the side of their head, they have 310 degrees’ vision. 
      This is much more than humans, who have 180 degree vision. When most deer are born, 
      they have white spots which disappear as they mature. 
      The spots help fawns to blend into their background, acting as camouflage.
      The average life span for deer in the wild is 15- 20 years.
