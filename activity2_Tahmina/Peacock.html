      “Peacock” refers to male birds, and peahens refer to female birds; collectively, they are called peafowls. The presence of huge tails and distinctive patterns on feathers makes them more fascinating.
      Peacock belongs to the pheasant family, which is native to Asia. There are three species of peacock, namely the Blue peacock, Green peacock, and African Congo peacock. The weight of male peacocks is around 4 to 6 kg, while 2.75 to 4 kg for females. 
      The length of the peacock is about 6 to 7 feet, while peahens are about 3 to 3.5 feet long. The average lifespan of peacocks is 15 to 20 years in the wild. 
      In Christianity, the peacock represents everlasting life. According to Greek mythologies, the peacock is associated with some goddess. 
      Peacock is a symbol of guardians for Babylonians.
