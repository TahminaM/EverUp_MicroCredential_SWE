    <h3>
      There are seven species of wolves. They include the Gray, Arctic, Eastern, 
      Ethiopian, Indian, Red and Himalayan Wolf. They are the largest member of the
       dog family. They tend to live in a pack, who serve as their family and
      protectors. Wolves have extremely powerful jaws. Fully grown wolves have a total of 42 teeth in their mouth. 
      They have the ability to create a 
      crushing pressure of about 1,500 pounds per square inch. That’s twice the pressure 
      that a dog’s jaw creates. 
      Wolves are carnivorous and commonly feed on deer, moose and
      bison. They are great hunters and can be as fast as 38 miles per hour. A wolf’s average life span ranges from 6 to 13 years.
